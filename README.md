# bit_z_bots_beta

## Bit-z-Bots: a web application for customizing and creating miniature 3D-printed robot figurines. Cute and unassuming, a Bit-z-Bot's noble purpose in its 3D-fabricated life is to inspire children's (and adults'!) interest in creative technology.

### BitzBots was accepted for exhibition at MakerFaire Bay Area 2017! Please visit [bitzbots.com](bitzbots.com) to make your own BitzBot!

#### The robot figurine you design is in STL format, compatible with most conventional fabricators, so it can be downloaded and 3D-printed anywhere you have access to a 3D printer!

#### Please look up your local libraries, schools and makerspaces if you do not have access to a 3D printer at home.
